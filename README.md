# Bullet Hell
Bullet Hell is a 2D, 1v1 platformer shooter. The aim of the game is for players to test their skills in a local
multiplayer environment, where one player uses a keyboard and mouse
and the other player uses a connected gamepad for control. The game is designed
in a pixelart style, with all visual elements created by a member of the development team, ensuring a consistent and unique look.
